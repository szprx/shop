# SPVA SHOP
It's my POV how should look web-shop. Of course mainly back-end part, I am poorly front-end skilled XD.


##How to run?
To run app you must have database, so run in cmd:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
After that you are ready to go to run this app. You can also use [PGADMIN4](https://localhost:5050) to view and manage db.
```bash
login : pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
password : adming
```
After running app its available at [SPVA-SHOP](https://localhost:8080)

For admin:
```bash
login : admin
password : admin
```
For normal user:
```bash
login : pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
password : adming
```
#### Why _"SPVA SHOP"_?
It's because two major technologies whose were used to create this app starts with Sp and Va.
